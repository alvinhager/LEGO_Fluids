# Master thesis at KTH  

This thesis work 

In this project for thesis work at KTH, a dynamic fluid simulation method PIC/FLIP is used to simulate water particle movements on a 3D grid. This simulation then outputs locations of LEGO bricks and their colours, which are used in a python script in Blender to render the animation frame by frame. The fluid simulation is coded in C++ and the script used to render the animation is coded in python. A section of code in the C++ fluid simulation is run on the GPU using CUDA, which is required to run the project. Currently, the project code is still quite messy (although functional) and will be updated. The thesis work adapts some code from another project which can be read more about in the acknowledgements section of the attached thesis pdf.
